								<p>A genomic analysis of more than 5,000 Chinese women with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) has identified and replicated <a href="#">two genome-wide significant loci contributing to risk of MDD</a> on chromosome 10. One is near the sirtuin1 (<em>SIRT1</em>) gene, and the other is in an intron of the phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (<em>LHPP</em>) gene. The association close to <a href="#"><em>SIRT1</em> may implicate abnormalities in mitochondria</a> as risk factors for the disease.</p>

								<p>Compared to nonmusicians, young children who strum a guitar or blow a trombone become better readers with better vocabularies. A new study shows that the benefits extend to teenagers as well. Neuroscientists compared two groups of high school students over 3 years: One began learning their first instrument in band class, whereas the other focused on physical fitness in Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC). At the end of 3 years, those <a href="#">students who had played instruments were better at detecting speech sounds</a>, like syllables and words that rhyme, than their JROTC peers, the team reports online today in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Researchers know that as children grow up, their ability to soak up new information, especially language, starts to diminish. These findings suggest that musical training could keep that window open longer. But the benefits of music aren’t just for musicians; taking up piano could be the difference between an A and a B in Spanish class.</p>

				<p>The centre of the historic city of Königsberg (today's Kaliningrad) is built on and around an island in the mouth of the Pregel River, between two of the river's branches. Seven bridges connect the island and the three surrounding parts of the city. In the early eighteenth century, a mathematical question arose that became famously known as 'the Seven bridges of Königsberg': is it possible to devise a loop walk that visits all four parts of the city, and in which all bridges are crossed only once? <a href="#">Read more</a></p>

				<p>Injecting single cells with spheres of fluorescent dye could open new research and treatment avenues using light.</p>
				<p>The system was devised by Seok Hyun Yun and Matjaž Humar, both optical physicists at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and uses droplets of fat or oil within a cell to reflect and amplify light, generating a laser.</p>
				<p>Yun had previously reported a method for generating laser light by engineering cells to express a fluorescent jellyfish protein, then placing a single such cell between a pair of external mirrors. His latest work goes a step further, producing a cell with a self-contained laser. <a href="#">Read more</a></p>

				<h1><a href="#">Neanderthals had outsize effect on human biology</a></h1>
				<p>From skin disorders to the immune system, sex with archaic species changed <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>
				<p>But these sequences may have had an outsize effect on human biology. In some cases, they are very different from the corresponding <em>H. sapiens</em> DNA, notes population geneticist David Reich of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts — which makes it more likely that they could introduce useful traits. “Even though it’s only a couple or a few per cent of ancestry, that ancestry was sufficiently distant that it punched above its weight,” he says. <a href="#">Read more</a></p>

Early reconstructions depicted a scaly beast that stood upright and dragged its tail on the ground, but recent research suggests the Cretaceous carnivore had a more agile horizontal posture and may have been covered in some sort of plumage.</p>
